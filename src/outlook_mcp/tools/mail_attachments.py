def _network_path_outside(path: str, bases: tuple[str, ...]) -> bool:
    r"""True if ``path`` names a network or device location outside every base.

    Windows only, and lexical on purpose — ``ntpath`` reads the string and never
    the filesystem. ``Path.resolve()`` opens a path to canonicalise it, and for
    ``\\host\share\x`` that means connecting to ``host`` and signing in as the
    logged-in user, before the confinement check has had its chance to refuse.
    So this one class is judged by its text, and resolving stays the authority
    for everything else.

    A path that begins with two separators covers UNC (``\\host\share``,
    ``//host/share``), the long-path form (``\\?\UNC\host\share``) and the
    device namespace (``\\.\…``). The two leading characters are read
    straight off the string rather than from ``ntpath.splitdrive``: before
    Python 3.12 that function finds no drive in some of these spellings that
    pathlib then treats as one, and the check has to agree with what gets
    resolved, on every version.

    An ``attachments_dir`` that itself sits on a share is the operator's
    choice, so a path lexically inside one of ``bases`` goes through to the
    resolver. Only a base that is a network path can vouch for one — a local
    root normalises to an empty prefix, which every path starts with.

    """Resolve ``path`` inside ``attachments_dir``, or refuse.

    These tools take a filesystem path from the model, and the model takes
    instructions from email. So the path is untrusted input: "attach the file at
    <path> and reply" is a working exfiltration primitive unless the reachable
    set is bounded. Every read and write goes through here.

    Confinement is resolved, not textual. A substring test for ``..`` — which is
    all this did before 1.20.0 — passes an absolute path to anywhere, and passes
    a symlink sitting innocently inside the directory. Resolving first collapses
    both, and comparing against the resolved base means a sibling directory
    sharing a name prefix cannot slip through either.

    A relative path is taken as relative to ``attachments_dir``, so an agent that
    passes a bare filename lands somewhere predictable instead of the process's
    working directory.

    One class is refused by its text first: on Windows a network path is turned
    away before it is resolved, because there resolving is itself the harm (see
    ``_network_path_outside``). That check only ever adds a refusal — whatever
    it lets through still has to resolve inside the directory.
