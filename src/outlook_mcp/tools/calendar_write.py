    """Update an existing calendar event.

    Only patches changed fields. ``None`` means "leave alone" for every
    argument, so ``False`` and ``[]`` are real instructions, not absences.

    ``attendees`` **replaces the whole collection** — Graph has no add-one
    operation, so pass the full intended list, and expect Outlook to email
    invitations to everyone on it and cancellations to anyone dropped. ``[]``
    removes them all. This is the one argument here with an outward-facing
    side effect.

    ``is_all_day`` requires ``start`` and ``end`` in the *same* call — Graph
    returns ``ErrorInvalidRequest: Missing parameters: Event.Start`` for a
    lone isAllDay patch — and both must fall on midnight boundaries. We reject
    the incomplete call locally rather than pass through that error.

    ``timezone`` re-anchors the event, and requires ``start`` and ``end`` in
    the same call for the same reason: Graph rejects a ``start`` patch that
    carries no ``timeZone`` at all (``TimeZoneNotSupportedException`` on the
    empty string), so the zone is never an independent edit. Omitted, the
    event keeps the zone it is already stored in — patching a colleague's
    09:00 New York meeting must not quietly move it to this server's zone,
    which is why this defaults differently from ``create_event``. Reading the
    stored zone costs one GET, issued only when ``start``/``end`` is in play,
    and the zone comes off ``originalStartTimeZone`` rather than
    ``start.timeZone``: see ``_anchor_zone`` for why the obvious field is the
    wrong one.

    Changing the zone of a *series master* needs the recurrence re-sent in the
    same patch; without it Graph answers ``400 ErrorPropertyValidationFailure``
    with nothing naming the zone. When the caller has not supplied a new
    recurrence, the event's existing one is read and sent back unchanged.

    There is deliberately no ``is_online`` here. Graph accepts ``isOnlineMeeting``
    on a personal (consumer) account and silently ignores it — a created or
    patched event comes back ``isOnlineMeeting: False, onlineMeetingProvider:
    'unknown'``. Teams meetings need a work/school account, which this server
    does not target. Adding the parameter would only ship a convincing no-op.

    Setting ``recurrence`` turns a single event into a series, or replaces the
    pattern of an existing one. It takes the same shapes as ``create_event``.
    Graph anchors the range on the series master's start, so when ``start``
    isn't part of the same patch the event's current start is read first.
    Passing ``None`` leaves any existing recurrence untouched — this is a
    partial patch.

    ``remove_recurrence=True`` turns a series master back into a single event,
    keeping the first occurrence's time. It is a separate flag rather than a
    sentinel value on ``recurrence`` because ``None`` there already means
    "leave alone", and the two are mutually exclusive.

    It has to go through ``additional_data``: Graph clears a series with an
    explicit ``"recurrence": null``, and ``event.recurrence = None`` does not
    produce one. The adapter serializes through the backing store, which writes
    a top-level null *beside* the object body rather than inside it, and then
    refuses the mixed document with ``ValueError("Invalid Json output")`` — so
    the plain assignment is not a silent no-op, it is an unsendable request.
    ``test_setting_event_recurrence_none_is_unsendable`` pins that; if kiota
    ever starts emitting a usable top-level null, it fails and this can be
    simplified.
