    ``recurrence`` accepts a Graph recurrence object, a JSON string of one, or
    a shorthand ("daily", "weekdays", "weekly", "monthly", "yearly"). Setting
    it makes the created event a series master rather than a single occurrence.

    ``timezone`` is the IANA zone the event is *anchored* in, defaulting to
    ``config.timezone``. It is the zone that governs the series, not a
    conversion applied to ``start``: an offset or ``Z`` in the datetime still
    pins the instant (Graph honours it), while the zone decides what the second
    occurrence of a weekly series does when daylight saving ends. Anchored in
    ``UTC`` — which is what this tool sent unconditionally before 1.23.0 — a
    09:00 series silently becomes 08:00 the week the clocks go back.

    A zone-less ``start``/``end`` ("2026-10-28T09:00:00") is read by Graph as
    wall-clock time *in that zone*, which is what ``config.timezone`` has
    always meant for input interpretation everywhere else in this server.

    The datetime string is passed through as the caller wrote it rather than
    normalized to UTC first. That is load-bearing twice over: normalizing a
    naive value needs a zone to resolve it against, and resolving it against
    the host's clock is the bug 1.15.0 removed; and Graph requires an all-day
    event to start on a midnight boundary, which a UTC conversion of local
    midnight is not.

    ``show_as`` is Graph's ``showAs`` — the free/busy status Outlook labels
    "Show as". Omitted, Graph applies its own default (``busy``); we do not
    send one, so the default stays Graph's to change.

    New parameters are appended to this signature rather than inserted:
    ``create_event`` is importable from the published package and nothing after
    ``graph_client`` is keyword-only, so a mid-signature insert would rebind a
    positional argument for an external caller. ``show_as`` therefore sits
    after ``timezone``, and ``server.py``'s positional call has to agree — a
    disagreement there only misfires when a value is actually supplied, so a

    """Update an existing calendar event.

    Only patches changed fields. ``None`` means "leave alone" for every
    argument, so ``False`` and ``[]`` are real instructions, not absences.

    ``attendees`` **replaces the whole collection** — Graph has no add-one
    operation, so pass the full intended list, and expect Outlook to email
    invitations to everyone on it and cancellations to anyone dropped. ``[]``
    removes them all. This is the one argument here with an outward-facing
    side effect.

    ``is_all_day`` requires ``start`` and ``end`` in the *same* call — Graph
    returns ``ErrorInvalidRequest: Missing parameters: Event.Start`` for a
    lone isAllDay patch — and both must fall on midnight boundaries. We reject
    the incomplete call locally rather than pass through that error.

    A ``start``/``end`` patch keeps the zone the event is already anchored in.
    Graph rejects a ``start`` patch carrying no ``timeZone`` at all
    (``TimeZoneNotSupportedException`` on the empty string), so one has to be
    sent, and the event's own is the only one that does not move it —
    patching a colleague's 09:00 New York meeting must not relocate it to this
    server's zone. That costs one GET, issued only when ``start``/``end`` is
    in play, and the zone comes off ``originalStartTimeZone`` rather than
    ``start.timeZone``: see ``_anchor_zones`` for why the obvious field is the
    wrong one, and why start and end are read separately.

    A consequence worth stating, because nothing else says it: a zone-less
    ``start``/``end`` here is read in the **event's** zone — not UTC as before
    this change, and not ``config.timezone`` as everywhere else in this server.
    Patching a colleague's New York meeting to ``"2026-11-03T09:00:00"`` means
    09:00 in New York, not 09:00 where this server is configured.

    ``timezone`` re-anchors the event into a *different* zone, and requires
    ``start`` and ``end`` in the same call for the reason above: Graph rejects a
    ``start`` patch carrying no ``timeZone``, so the zone is never an
    independent edit. Passing it without them is refused rather than answered
    ``updated``. One zone re-anchors both ends, which is what "move this to
    Eastern" means; an event whose ends genuinely differ keeps them by omitting
    the argument.

    Changing a **series master's** zone needs its recurrence re-sent in the
    same patch. Without it Graph answers ``400 ErrorPropertyValidationFailure``,
    which names neither the zone nor the property; with it the identical patch
    succeeds. Both verified live, with the zone unchanged and a single instance
    as controls. When the caller has not supplied a new recurrence the event's
    existing one is read and sent back, so a series created before events
    carried a zone can be repaired in place rather than deleted and rebuilt.
    Its days move with the start's local date (``_follow_new_start``): a
    Thursday 02:00Z series re-anchored to Los Angeles becomes a Wednesday one.

    Any ``start``, ``end`` or ``recurrence`` patch to a series master that has
    edited or deleted occurrences is refused, naming them. Graph restores every
    one of them when a master's times or pattern change — zone or not — and
    reports success. Measured live; see ``_OCCURRENCE_SELECT``.

    It cannot be combined with an all-day event, and that is refused rather than
    ignored: Graph stores an all-day event anchored in UTC whatever zone it is
    sent, so there is no zone to move it to and accepting the argument would
    report success for nothing.

    There is deliberately no ``is_online`` here. Graph accepts ``isOnlineMeeting``
    on a personal (consumer) account and silently ignores it — a created or
    patched event comes back ``isOnlineMeeting: False, onlineMeetingProvider:
    'unknown'``. Teams meetings need a work/school account, which this server
    does not target. Adding the parameter would only ship a convincing no-op.

    Setting ``recurrence`` turns a single event into a series, or replaces the
    pattern of an existing one. It takes the same shapes as ``create_event``.
    Graph anchors the range on the series master's start, so when ``start``
    isn't part of the same patch the event's current start is read first. When
    it is, a supplied ``range.startDate`` is dropped and re-derived from it, and
    a pattern equal to the stored one moves with it — so ``outlook_get_event``'s
    recurrence can be handed back beside a new start and zone.
    Passing ``None`` leaves any existing recurrence untouched — this is a
    partial patch.

    ``remove_recurrence=True`` turns a series master back into a single event,
    keeping the first occurrence's time. It is a separate flag rather than a
    sentinel value on ``recurrence`` because ``None`` there already means
    "leave alone", and the two are mutually exclusive.

    It has to go through ``additional_data``: Graph clears a series with an
    explicit ``"recurrence": null``, and ``event.recurrence = None`` does not
    produce one. The adapter serializes through the backing store, which writes
    a top-level null *beside* the object body rather than inside it, and then
    refuses the mixed document with ``ValueError("Invalid Json output")`` — so
    the plain assignment is not a silent no-op, it is an unsendable request.
    ``test_setting_event_recurrence_none_is_unsendable`` pins that; if kiota
    ever starts emitting a usable top-level null, it fails and this can be
    simplified.

    ``show_as`` patches Graph's ``showAs`` and needs nothing else resent — it is
    not ``is_all_day``. Graph honours all six values on PATCH for a consumer
    mailbox, verified live. Omitting it leaves the event's current status alone;
    there is no value that clears one, because Graph has no such state.
