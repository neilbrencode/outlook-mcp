"""To Do task attachment tools: list, download, upload, delete.

To Do attachments (taskFileAttachment) are not mail FileAttachments: the
resource lives under ``/me/todo/lists/{id}/tasks/{taskId}/attachments`` and
the content endpoint is ``.../attachments/{id}/$value``.

Creation is an inline base64 POST — a ``taskFileAttachment`` with
``contentBytes`` sent to the attachments collection. The upload-session
route also exists on consumer outlook.com mailboxes
(``POST .../attachments/createUploadSession``, verified live), but its
upload URL is a ``graph.microsoft.com`` route rather than a pre-authenticated
``outlook.office.com`` one like mail's: every chunk PUT needs an
``Authorization`` header (401 "Access token is empty" without it, verified)
and a ``Content-Type`` header (400 without it, verified), plus response
checking and offset-following of ``nextExpectedRanges``. At the sizes this
tool accepts, inline is one round-trip through kiota's throttling and retry;
it was verified live on a consumer mailbox from 64 bytes to the full 20 MiB
ceiling. The session route is the documented future path above that.

Size ceiling: the inline POST is one JSON document, Graph refuses bodies over
30 MB, and base64 inflates content 4/3 — the hard limit is ~22.5 MB of raw
file. The client-side ceiling is 20 MiB, leaving room for the JSON envelope
and the filename.

Downloads read the attachment entity and take ``contentBytes`` from it (the
same style as ``mail_attachments.download_attachment``; kiota base64-decodes
into raw bytes) rather than minting a raw bearer token against ``$value``.
