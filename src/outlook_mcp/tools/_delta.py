"""Shared helpers for Graph ``$delta`` queries.

These tools deliberately bypass the msgraph SDK and hit Graph's delta
endpoints with raw httpx. The SDK's typed delta builders rebuild URL
templates from query-parameter dataclasses (so a deltaLink passed through
them gets its ``$deltatoken`` stripped) and discard the ``@removed``
annotation on returned items, which delta-query callers need to detect
tombstones. Raw httpx is also easier to wire to the per-endpoint quirks
documented inline:

- ``/me/calendarView/delta`` requires ``startDateTime`` + ``endDateTime``
  on the first call but rejects ``$top``; you must pass
  ``Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=N`` instead.
- ``/me/contacts/delta`` accepts no query string at all on the first call;
  ``Prefer: odata.maxpagesize=N`` is again how you size the page.
- ``/me/mailFolders/{id}/messages/delta`` accepts ``$top``.

Tokens are *not* persisted by outlook-mcp — that's the caller's job (an
agent decides where it wants to store its watermark). We pass the raw
``@odata.deltaLink`` / ``@odata.nextLink`` URL through as the opaque
cursor string.

That last point is why ``require_graph_url`` exists: because the cursor
lives outside this process and comes back in as a request URL carrying the
mailbox bearer token, it is untrusted input, and every URL that would
receive the token is checked against ``graph.microsoft.com`` first.

    With ``resource`` ("mail", "calendar" or "contacts") the path must also be
    that tool's delta endpoint — see ``_DELTA_ENDPOINTS``. The host is checked
    first either way: an off-Graph URL is the worse failure and gets its own
    error.

    Every URL this module requests carries the mailbox bearer token, and two of
    them arrive from outside: the caller's ``delta_token`` and the
    ``@odata.nextLink`` read back out of a response body. Neither is trustworthy
    — an agent that reads mail can be told what cursor to use — so the host is
    checked before the token is attached, not after.

    ``resolve_attachment_path`` resolves instead of comparing substrings: a

    ``evil.example``) and ``https://graph.microsoft.com.evil.example/``.

    Parsing alone is not enough either, because parsers disagree. ``urlsplit``
    deletes tab/CR/LF before parsing while an HTTP client does not, so the two
    can read different hosts out of one string. The characters that cause the
    disagreement are refused outright, and the comparison is against the whole
    ``netloc`` rather than ``hostname`` so userinfo and an explicit port — the
    other two classic sources of parser differentials — are refused with it.

    Behavior:

    - When ``delta_token`` is provided it's used as the request URL
      verbatim — it's already a full Graph URL (either a deltaLink that
      starts a new sync round or a nextLink that resumes an in-progress
      one). ``initial_url`` is ignored in that case.
    - When ``delta_token`` is ``None`` we hit ``initial_url`` (the
      caller-built first-sync URL with whatever query params and
      Prefer headers the resource accepts).
    - We auto-follow ``@odata.nextLink`` inside a single tool call up to
      ``page_size * PAGE_SIZE_CAP_MULTIPLIER`` items so an agent isn't
      forced to chain four follow-up calls just to drain Graph's
      pagination on a large initial snapshot.
    - We stop early on the cap and surface ``has_more=True`` plus the
      nextLink as the returned token so the caller can resume.
    - We stop on a ``deltaLink`` and surface ``has_more=False`` plus the
      deltaLink as the returned token — the caller stores that and uses
      it for the *next* sync round.
    - If Graph returns neither (rare but valid: zero changes plus no
      deltaLink, which means the previous token is still valid), we
      return ``has_more=False`` and ``delta_token=None`` so the caller
      keeps using their old token.

    Returns ``(raw_items, next_token, has_more)``. ``raw_items`` is the
    accumulated list of dicts straight from Graph; the per-resource
    wrapper is responsible for mapping them through ``format_delta_item``
    with the right per-item formatter.
