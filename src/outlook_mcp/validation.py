    Shared by the calendar read path (where ``name`` is ``config.timezone``)
    and the calendar write path (where it is that or a caller-supplied
    ``timezone`` argument). An unhandled ``ZoneInfoNotFoundError`` reaches the
    model as a message-free ``Error executing tool …`` — ``_wrap_tool_errors``
    keeps the text of an *unexpected* exception on the server, which is right
    for a crash and wrong for a bad zone name. Raising ``ValueError`` routes it
    through ``ToolInputError`` instead, so the message survives the trip.

    The three ways the lookup fails need different fixes, so they get different
    messages: an abbreviation is the mistake an agent actually makes and the
    one Graph answers with an opaque ``TimeZoneNotSupportedException``; a name
    no database contains is a typo; no database at all is a broken install —
    ``tzdata`` is a dependency exactly so that Windows and slim Linux images
    have one.

    ``ValueError`` is caught alongside ``ZoneInfoNotFoundError`` because
    zoneinfo raises it, not the subclass, for a path-shaped key:
    ``/etc/localtime`` is a plausible thing to put in a config file and would
    otherwise escape both the truncation and the hint. ``OSError`` joins them
    because ``ZoneInfo`` resolves a name against the filesystem where one
    exists, so a name too long to be a path component fails there instead —
    ``'x' * 256`` raises ``OSError [Errno 63] File name too long`` on macOS
    while raising ``ZoneInfoNotFoundError`` on a Windows tzdata-only install.
    That platform split is why it went unnoticed: the escape is invisible on
    the machine this was written on, and reaches the model as a message-free
    crash on the maintainer's.

    ``remedy`` is appended to the not-a-zone message, and the caller supplies
    it because only the caller knows where the value came from. Naming
    ``config.json`` unconditionally told a *model* to go and edit the
    operator's config file to fix its own tool argument.

    Same standard as :func:`validate_event_timezone` with one exception, and
    the exception is the point: a *stored* ``config.timezone`` of ``EST`` came
    from an install that worked. Before events carried a real zone at all, the
    value was never sent — every event went out labelled ``UTC`` — so nothing
    ever rejected it, and a config file on disk today can perfectly well hold
    one. Refusing it here would leave that server running, reading calendars
    happily, and failing every ``outlook_create_event`` that does not pass an
    explicit ``timezone``. An upgrade must not do that.

    So such a value falls back to ``UTC`` — which is *exactly* what every event
    this server wrote was anchored in before 1.23.0 — and says so, once per run
    per name, naming the config key and the one-line change that earns the fix.
    Nothing about that install gets worse; it simply does not get better until
    someone edits the config.

    Translating ``EST`` to ``America/New_York`` was the obvious alternative and
    is wrong: they are not the same zone. ``EST`` is a fixed UTC−05:00 with no
    daylight saving, which is how ``resolve_timezone`` — and therefore every
    calendar *read* — already interprets that config value. Anchoring writes in
    a DST-observing zone would make the two halves of the server disagree about
    the same string every summer, and would be this function inventing a
    meaning the operator never asked for. The same argument is why a *typo* is
