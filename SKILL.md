# outlook-mcp

MCP server for Microsoft Outlook personal accounts (Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live).
Provides AI agents with full access to mail, calendar, contacts, and tasks via Microsoft Graph API.

> Independent open-source project. Not affiliated with Microsoft.

## Agent-friendly

Pass `concise=True` to read tools (`outlook_list_inbox`, `outlook_read_message`, `outlook_search_mail`, `outlook_list_events`, `outlook_list_thread`) to drop large body fields — ~10× fewer tokens for triage scans. Graph errors are wrapped into structured `{code, message, action}` responses with recovery hints (re-auth on 401, ROADMAP link on 403/ErrorAccessDenied, re-list on 404, back-off on 429, retry on 503). v1.9.1 docstring audit: every `@mcp.tool()` docstring rewritten to a consistent shape with contrastive pointers for ambiguous pairs and concrete syntax examples, designed to reduce wrong-tool selection by LLMs.

## Important

- **Personal Microsoft accounts only** (`@outlook.com`, `@hotmail.com`, `@live.com`). Work/school accounts (Entra ID) are not supported in v1.
- **Requires Azure AD app registration** — free, takes ~5 minutes, but you need a free Azure account first. See README.
- **Auth is CLI-based** — run `outlook-mcp auth` on the host before the agent can use it. No interactive auth through MCP tools.

## Setup

1. **Create a free Azure account** at [azure.microsoft.com/free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) (sign up with your `@outlook.com` address)
2. **Register an Azure AD app** (see README for step-by-step)
3. **Configure:** Create `~/.outlook-mcp/config.json`, saved as UTF-8:
   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "YOUR-APP-CLIENT-ID",
     "tenant_id": "consumers",
     "timezone": "America/Los_Angeles",
     "read_only": true,
     "attachments_dir": "~/.outlook-mcp/attachments"
   }
   ```
4. **Install:**
   ```bash
   uv tool install outlook-graph-mcp
   ```
   Installs the released wheel from PyPI and puts `outlook-mcp` on your PATH. Upgrade later
   with `uv tool upgrade outlook-graph-mcp`.
5. **Register with OpenClaw** (writes to `mcp.servers` in `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):
   ```bash
   openclaw mcp set outlook '{"command":"outlook-mcp"}'
   openclaw mcp list   # verify
   ```
6. **Authenticate on the host:**
   ```bash
   outlook-mcp auth
   ```
7. **Restart the gateway:** `openclaw gateway restart`

> Working on outlook-mcp itself? Clone the repo and use
> `uv run --directory /path/to/outlook-mcp outlook-mcp` as the command instead — see the
> README. The PyPI install above is the right one for using it.

## Prompts (3)

- `morning_brief(folder="inbox")` — today's events, unread mail and tasks due, in the cheapest order
- `triage_folder(folder="inbox", count=50)` — one scan, sorted, applied in a single batch call
- `catch_up(since="24h")` — what changed, via the delta path

## Tools (68)

### Auth
- `outlook_auth_status` — Check authentication status and read-only mode

### Mail — Read
- `outlook_list_inbox` — List messages with filters (folder, unread, sender, date, category, Focused class)
- `outlook_read_message` — Get full message by ID
- `outlook_read_messages` — Bulk read up to 20 messages by ID in one `$batch` round-trip (use NOT N read_message calls)
- `outlook_search_mail` — Search mail using KQL query
- `outlook_list_folders` — List all mail folders
- `outlook_list_inbox_delta` — List only inbox changes since last call (massive token savings for recurring agent jobs)

### Mail — Write
- `outlook_send_message` — Send email with recipients, CC, BCC, HTML, importance
- `outlook_reply` — Reply or reply-all to a message
- `outlook_forward` — Forward a message

### Mail — Triage
- `outlook_move_message` — Move to a folder
- `outlook_delete_message` — Delete (soft by default, permanent optional)
- `outlook_flag_message` — Set follow-up flag
- `outlook_categorize_message` — Set categories
- `outlook_mark_read` — Mark read or unread
- `outlook_reclassify_message` — Move between Focused Inbox and Other
- `outlook_list_inbox_overrides` — List Focused Inbox per-sender override rules
- `outlook_set_inbox_override` — Upsert a per-sender override (focused/other)
- `outlook_delete_inbox_override` — Delete an override by ID

### Calendar
- `outlook_list_events` — List events in date range (expands recurring); each carries `type` (`occurrence`/`exception` for a series instance vs `singleInstance`; a `seriesMaster` never appears on a listing — use `outlook_get_event`) and `show_as` (the free/busy status); `calendar` reads a secondary calendar by name or ID (default calendar when omitted); a cursor continues the same calendar. `concise=True` drops `type` and `show_as`
- `outlook_get_event` — Get event details, incl. `recurrence`, `type` (`seriesMaster` etc.), `show_as`, and `original_start_time_zone` (the zone the event is anchored in; `start`/`end` are UTC)
- `outlook_list_events_delta` — List only event changes since last call within a window (massive token savings for recurring agent jobs); each changed event carries every field the *default* `outlook_list_events` listing returns (not `concise=True`'s narrower shape), `type` and `show_as` included, plus `is_deleted` (`True` on a tombstone, which carries only `id`); unlike the listing this one **does** return `seriesMaster` items
- `outlook_create_event` — Create event with attendees, online meeting; `recurrence` (shorthand or Graph object) creates a series; `timezone` (IANA name) anchors it, defaulting to the config timezone; `show_as` sets Outlook's "Show as" (`free`/`tentative`/`busy`/`oof`/`workingElsewhere`/`unknown`, Graph defaults to `busy`)
- `outlook_update_event` — Update event fields incl. attendees (replaces the list, sends invites), all-day and `show_as`; `recurrence` converts a single event into a series, `remove_recurrence=True` converts it back; patching a time keeps the zone the event is anchored in, and `timezone` (with start and end) re-anchors it elsewhere; a `start`, `end` or `recurrence` patch to a series with edited or deleted occurrences is refused, because Graph would discard them
- `outlook_delete_event` — Delete event
- `outlook_rsvp` — Accept, decline, or tentatively accept

### Contacts
- `outlook_list_contacts` — List with cursor pagination; summaries carry `categories`
- `outlook_search_contacts` — Search by name or email; results omit `categories` (Graph's contact `$search` does not return them — read the contact back if you need them)
- `outlook_get_contact` — Get full details incl. home/business/other addresses, categories, personal notes
- `outlook_create_contact` — Create (no address: add one with `outlook_update_contact` afterwards)
- `outlook_update_contact` — Update fields; `home_address`/`business_address`/`other_address` take `{street, city, state, postal_code, country_or_region}` (the shape `outlook_get_contact` returns) and **replace** that whole address, so pass back every part you want to keep
- `outlook_delete_contact` — Delete
- `outlook_list_contacts_delta` — List only contact changes since last call (massive token savings for recurring agent jobs)

### Digest
- `outlook_changes_since` — One structured "since last call" digest across mail, events, and contacts. Composes the three delta tools into counts + urgent-flagged mail + top-5 senders + new/cancelled events; auto-recovers from stale tokens. Designed for recurring agent loops (morning brief, hourly inbox sweep).

### To Do

- `outlook_download_task_attachment` — Download task attachment content to attachments_dir
- `outlook_upload_task_attachment` — Attach a local file to a task via inline base64 POST (1 byte – 20 MiB)

- `outlook_attach_to_draft` — Add attachments to an existing draft (auto upload session for >3MB)
- `outlook_remove_draft_attachment` — Remove a single attachment from a draft

### Folder Management
- `outlook_create_folder` — Create (top-level or nested)
- `outlook_rename_folder` — Rename

### Threading and Batch
- `outlook_list_thread` — Get all messages in a conversation
- `outlook_copy_message` — Copy to another folder
- `outlook_batch_triage` — Batch move/flag/categorize/mark_read (max 20)

### User and Admin
- `outlook_whoami` — Current user profile
- `outlook_list_calendars` — Available calendars
- `outlook_list_categories` — Category definitions with colors
- `outlook_get_mail_tips` — Pre-send check (OOF, delivery restrictions)

## Privacy
- Zero telemetry, zero local caching
- Only connects to `login.microsoftonline.com` and `graph.microsoft.com`
- Tokens stored in the OS keyring (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Store, libsecret on Linux). Without an encrypted store the server refuses to persist them unless `allow_unencrypted_token_cache` is set.
- BYOID: you register your own Azure AD app — no shared client ID

## Notes
- IDs are opaque Graph strings — get them from list/search tools, never guess
- Dates take ISO 8601 or a relative offset (`7d` ago, `+7d` from now, `now`); responses are UTC. A zone-less date is read in the config timezone — except on `outlook_update_event`, where it is read in the zone the event itself is anchored in, so patching a colleague's New York meeting to `09:00` means 09:00 *there*
- A recurring event is expanded in the zone it is anchored in, so pass `timezone` (or set the config one) when creating a series that crosses a daylight-saving change — anchored in UTC, a 09:00 weekly meeting becomes 08:00 when the clocks go back. Use a zone name (`America/Los_Angeles`), never an abbreviation (`PDT`)
- Attachments may only be read from or written to `attachments_dir` — put a file there before asking for it to be sent
- Three workflow prompts ship with the server: `morning_brief`, `triage_folder`, `catch_up`
- Mail search uses KQL syntax
- Start with `read_only: true`, flip when comfortable
- **Granular permissions:** For finer control, set `allow_categories` in config (e.g., `["calendar_write"]` to allow only calendar writes). See README for the 7 categories and example policies.
- **Toolset selection:** Set `OUTLOOK_MCP_TOOLSETS` (e.g. `mail,calendar,digest,delta`) to load only the tool groups you use and cut per-turn context; unset loads all 68. Tools carry read-only / destructive annotations so clients can auto-approve reads.
- **Two accounts:** One server serves one mailbox. Register a second server entry with its own `OUTLOOK_MCP_CONFIG_DIR` (e.g. `~/.outlook-mcp-work`) and run `outlook-mcp auth` once with that variable set. Move only the config directory, never `HOME` — see README "Two accounts, two instances".
