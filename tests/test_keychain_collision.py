"""The two-process invariants for a shared token cache, pinned offline.

How the cache really works, from azure-identity's own persistence layer:

- On macOS, every persisted azure-identity cache on the host — this server's,
  Visual Studio's, the Azure CLI's — serializes into ONE Keychain item:
  service ``Microsoft.Developer.IdentityService``, account ``MSALCache``.
  ``TokenCachePersistenceOptions(name=...)`` does NOT buy a second Keychain
  item. It buys a distinct *signal file* — on disk
  ``~/.IdentityService/outlook-mcp.nocae``: azure-identity appends a
  suffix to every cache name (``.nocae`` non-CAE, ``.cae`` CAE), so the
  name keys the signal file, never the storage —
  which is the lock-and-merge coordinator: a credential whose signal file
  says "changed" reloads the shared item, merges its accounts, and writes the
  whole view back under a lock. Windows (a DPAPI file per name) and Linux
  (libsecret keyed by name) really do key storage by name; macOS does not.
  The comment must not claim more for a cache name than that.

That fact makes the one-process-per-account design (each instance sets
``OUTLOOK_MCP_CONFIG_DIR``) correct only while two invariants hold, and this
suite holds them offline:

1. every credential writes through the ONE cache name — one signal file, so
   every writer goes through the same lock-and-merge into the one item;
2. authenticating instance B must not evict instance A: with one shared name,
   B's save serializes a view that *includes* A's account; giving each
   instance its own name (the tempting "isolation") makes B load an empty
   view instead, and B's save clobbers the shared item — a bug no mock of
   Graph can see, because it happens entirely inside the cache;
3. each instance's AuthenticationRecord is what pins which identity in the
   merged item its credential serves — the record, not the client, selects
   the account.

Reintroducing per-instance cache names, or losing the per-instance record,
fails loudly here instead of only in a live run against a real Keychain.
