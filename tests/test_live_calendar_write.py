"""Write-tier live guards for recurring events (#41).

Why this tier exists: the mock suite asserts what we *build*. It cannot see
Graph reject what we built. A `PatternedRecurrence` that is perfectly
well-formed to the SDK still returns ErrorInvalidRecurrenceRange if the range
disagrees with the series master's start — exactly the failure mode this fix
had to get right — and 609 green mock tests would not notice.

Read `tests/conftest.py` before adding anything here: no attendees, no
unbounded ranges, calendar only, and everything created is deleted in a
`finally`.
