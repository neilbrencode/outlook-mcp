"""The tool surface is a per-turn cost, so it gets a ceiling.

Every client pays for all 68 tool schemas on every turn that includes them.
ROADMAP records a measured baseline of ~8,644 tokens (o200k proxy, 2026-07), and
that number is what makes the `OUTLOOK_MCP_TOOLSETS` gating worth having — but
nothing stopped it drifting upward one well-meant docstring at a time.

This is a budget, not a golden file. A golden snapshot of the schemas would fail
on every wording change and be regenerated without being read, which teaches
nobody anything. A ceiling only fires when the surface gets materially more
expensive, and that is the moment worth a conversation: adding a tool, or adding
a field to all 68.

Raising the ceiling is a legitimate outcome — a new tool has to go somewhere. It
just has to be deliberate, with the new number written down next to the reason.

# Ceiling for the full tool surface. Measured at 11,206 on 1.20.0 with a
# 12,000 ceiling; raised to 13,500 for the eight To Do detail tools
# (get_task, checklist-item CRUD, task attachments), then to 13,650 after
# the attachment rewrite (measured 12,855 at the time) — each a deliberate
# "a new tool has to go somewhere" raise, not drift. Re-measured 13,154
# after the rebase onto main picked up #76's time-zone anchoring (which
# grew create/get/update_event, not just `outlook_create_event`'s new
# parameter) and the upload-session docstring note.
#
# 13,156 on the 68-tool surface: the two in-process account-switching tools
# came off (barely ~20 tokens between them — two of the smallest schemas on
# the surface), and the attachment-path docstrings stopped naming a default
# an override moves anyway (+22). Ceiling 13,300 holds ~1% headroom: room
# for a wording fix, not for another batch.
#
# 13,245 with `outlook_update_event`'s `timezone` argument and the sentence that
# says it re-anchors (+55), and one sentence saying a series with edited or
# deleted occurrences will not be reshaped (+34) — silent data loss, so it goes
# where the model reads it. The other refusals carry their remedies in the error
# text rather than in the schema every turn pays for.
