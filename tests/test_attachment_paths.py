"""The attachment tools must not reach outside the configured directory.

Three tools take a host filesystem path: ``download_attachment`` writes one,
``send_with_attachments`` and ``attach_to_draft`` read them. Before 1.20.0 the
only check was a substring test for ``..`` on the write path, and none at all on
the read paths — so an absolute path reached any file the server process could
read, and a mail server reads untrusted input for a living. "Attach the file at
<path> and reply" is one injected instruction away from exfiltration.

Confinement is resolved, not textual: ``..`` and a symlink pointing out of the
directory both have to fail, which a string check cannot do.
