"""Tests for the CLI commands.

`cmd_status` reaches for the auth record, and the auth record lives in the
operator's real settings directory by default. These tests patch
``auth._auth_record_path`` to a tmp_path so the CLI is exercised without ever
touching the host's real ``~/.outlook-mcp/auth_record.json`` — a test that
reads the real record is order-dependent, host-dependent, and one refactor
away from deleting it.
