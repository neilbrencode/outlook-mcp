# Releasing outlook-mcp

Checklist for cutting a new release.

## 1. Smoke-test against the live Graph API

```bash
uv run python scripts/preflight.py
```

Hits every Graph endpoint family the tools depend on with the locally-cached token. Flags any endpoint that returns 403 or 501 — the "not supported for this account type" signal that mocked unit tests can't catch.

Read-only. No writes, no sends, no mailbox state changes.

If the script reports failures, do not tag. Either fix the affected tools or remove them from the release. v1.7.0 shipped four tools backed by `/me/mailboxSettings/*` that Microsoft Graph does not support on personal accounts; v1.7.1 yanked them. This script would have caught it in 30 seconds.

When adding a new tool that hits a Graph endpoint family not yet covered, add a row to `ENDPOINTS` in `scripts/preflight.py`.

## 1b. Live query-shape tests

```bash
uv run pytest -m live -v
```

Preflight answers "does this endpoint exist and respond?" — it treats a 400 as a non-blocking SKIP. This tier answers the different question: **does Graph accept and correctly evaluate the queries we actually build?**

That gap shipped three bugs in 1.12.0, all under a fully green mock suite:

- `$orderby` + any non-date `$filter` → `400 InefficientFilter`, breaking `from_address` and `classification` on every call (#31)
- `list_thread` hit the same rule and 400'd unconditionally — it had never worked in a released version
- `sanitize_kql` stripped `:`, so every documented KQL property restriction returned `200` with **zero results** (#30)

The second failure mode is the dangerous one: a silent 200 with wrong data. Mocks assert what we *send*; only a live call sees what Graph *does*. These tests assert on returned data, not just absence of an exception.

Read-only, and mailbox-independent — they harvest their own fixtures and skip cleanly when the mailbox lacks the needed data. Auto-skipped without a cached token.

If you change how any `$filter`, `$orderby` or `$search` string is built, run this before tagging.

## 1c. Integration smoke tests

```bash
uv run pytest -m integration -v
```

Response-shape checks for each tool family. Read-only.

> These skipped silently for their entire existence — the fixture called a non-existent `AuthManager.login()`, and the `except Exception` swallowed the `AttributeError`. Fixed in 1.13.0. If you see `skipped` here, confirm it's really a missing token and not a broken fixture.

## 1d. Write-tier guards (calendar only)

```bash
OUTLOOK_MCP_LIVE_WRITE=1 uv run pytest -m live_write -v
```

The only tier that writes. It creates short, bounded, attendee-free recurring events on the authenticated calendar and deletes each one in a `finally`.

It exists because recurrence cannot be validated any other way: a `PatternedRecurrence` that is well-formed to the SDK still 400s with `ErrorInvalidRecurrenceRange` if the range disagrees with the series master's start. `outlook_create_event` accepted a `recurrence` argument and silently discarded it for fourteen minor versions (#41) under a fully green mock suite — mocks assert what we *build*.

Double-gated on purpose: the marker is deselected by default **and** the tier skips without `OUTLOOK_MCP_LIVE_WRITE=1`, so a cached token alone can never write to a calendar. Run it if you changed anything under `tools/_recurrence.py` or `calendar_write.py`. See the rules at the top of `tests/conftest.py` before adding to it.

## 2. Tests + lint

```bash
uv run pytest --tb=no -q
uv run ruff check src/ tests/
```

The default run is the offline unit suite only — `addopts` deselects the `integration`, `live` and `live_write` markers, so this needs no network or token. Expect zero failures; the deselected count is those three tiers, and grows as they do.

## 3. Version bump

Update in lockstep:

- `pyproject.toml` — `version = "X.Y.Z"`
- `server.json` — both `version` fields + `description` (tool count if it changed)
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — both tool-count asserts. The fresh-install one pins the working tree's surface (a release that adds or removes a tool updates it in the same PR). The `published-install` one pins the count of the **PyPI-latest** release, so it is only correct until the next publish; leaving it stale turns the weekly canary permanently red the day the release lands
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` entry
- `SKILL.md` — `## Tools (N)` heading + frontmatter `description` if count changed
- `README.md` — counts and tables if they changed
- `ROADMAP.md` — move shipped items from Near-term to Done
- `CLAUDE.md` — tools listing if you added/removed a module

## 4. PR + merge

```bash
gh pr create --title "vX.Y.Z: <summary>" --body "<changelog excerpt>"
# wait for CI green
gh pr merge <num> --rebase --delete-branch
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only
```

## 5. Tag + GitHub release — this publishes everything

```bash
gh release create vX.Y.Z --target main --title "vX.Y.Z" --notes "<changelog body>"
```

Publishing the release triggers `.github/workflows/publish.yml`, which re-checks the version lockstep, runs tests and lint, builds, publishes to **PyPI**, waits for PyPI's index to catch up, then publishes to the **MCP registry**. Both authenticate through GitHub OIDC — no stored tokens, and no five-minute registry login to race by hand.

Watch it:

```bash
gh run watch
```

If it fails partway, re-run it. Uploads already on PyPI are skipped, so a dispatch retries only what didn't finish:

```bash
gh workflow run publish.yml
```

The MCP registry step uses a pinned, checksum-verified `mcp-publisher` (`scripts/install-mcp-publisher.sh`), because that job holds the publishing credential. If the registry ever refuses the pinned version, move the pin — the script says how — in a PR before tagging; CI's `mcp-publisher-pin` job checks the new pin.

> The workflow deliberately does **not** run the live tier — those need real credentials. Step 1 is still yours, and still the step that matters: a green offline suite is exactly what shipped 1.13.0 and 1.13.1 broken.

### Hotfix — when `main` isn't ready to ship

When a published release needs an urgent fix but `main` carries merged work that hasn't been through the live tier, cut the patch from the tag instead of from `main`. 1.22.1 was released this way, from `v1.22.0`:

```bash
git fetch origin --tags
git push origin "vX.Y.Z^{commit}:refs/heads/release/X.Y.x"   # release branch at the published tag
git switch -c hotfix/X.Y.Z+1 origin/release/X.Y.x
git cherry-pick <fix commit(s) from main>                    # then the §3 version bump, in its own commit
gh pr create --base release/X.Y.x                            # CI runs on it like any PR; merge when green
gh release create vX.Y.Z+1 --target release/X.Y.x --title "vX.Y.Z+1" --notes-file <notes>
```

Run steps 1–1c from the hotfix branch, not `main`. After publishing, open a PR against `main` that moves the fix's CHANGELOG entry out of `[Unreleased]` into a `## [X.Y.Z+1]` section. Leave `main`'s `pyproject.toml` and `server.json` versions alone; the next release from `main` bumps past both. ClawHub (§6) publishes from a checkout of the hotfix branch — mind §6b's `--slug`.

## 6. Publish to ClawHub (the one manual channel)

ClawHub has no OIDC equivalent, so it stays hand-run. Three steps, and the first and last are the ones that matter.

**6a. Check the CLI is current — nothing else will.**

```bash
clawhub --cli-version; npm view clawhub version   # must match
npm i -g clawhub@latest                            # it's npm-global under Homebrew's node, not a brew formula
```

Site discovery advertises `minCliVersion: "0.1.0"`, so an arbitrarily old client is accepted without a warning. On 2026-09-07 a v0.9.0 client (latest was v0.23.3) printed `✔ OK. Published outlook-mcp@1.15.0` for a submission that was actually pending security scans, and two releases were reported as published to users before anyone checked. Current clients print `pending security scans before it becomes public`, which is the truth.

**6b. Publish.**

```bash
clawhub publish "$(pwd)" --slug outlook-mcp --name outlook-mcp --version X.Y.Z --tags latest --changelog "<one-liner>" --dry-run
# must print: Would publish outlook-mcp@X.Y.Z — then run it again without --dry-run
```

**`--slug` and `--name` are not optional.** Without them the CLI names the skill after the folder. That's harmless from a clone called `outlook-mcp`, but 1.22.1, published from a worktree called `hotfix-1.22.1`, went out as a brand-new skill `hotfix-1-22-1` — and the CLI printed "Update submitted" exactly as it does for the real one. An owner can't delete a skill while its scan is pending, so the stray could only be removed after it went public. The dry run is the one place the slug is visible before it matters.

Expect it to take a minute or two and to say **pending security scans**. That is success. The scan has taken ~12 min to ~1 h in practice; the version is not public until it clears.

Note that ClawHub bundles the **whole repo** (everything not in `.gitignore` with a text extension — `tests/` included), not the wheel. Don't leave one-off scripts that touch real data lying in the tree at publish time.

**6c. Verify — the CLI's success message is not verification.**

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/outlook-mcp/versions/X.Y.Z   # 200 once public
curl -s https://clawhub.ai/api/v1/skills/outlook-mcp | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['latestVersion']['version'])"
```

`404` immediately after publishing is normal (scan pending). `404` an hour later is not — and `clawhub publish` will then refuse the same version number as a duplicate, so don't burn versions probing it; ask on <https://github.com/openclaw/clawhub/issues> (see #3623 for the shape of this).

## 7. Update GitHub About

If tool count or categories changed:

```bash
gh repo edit mpalermiti/outlook-mcp --description "MCP server for Microsoft Outlook personal accounts via Microsoft Graph API. N tools across K categories — mail, calendar, contacts, tasks, drafts, attachments. Community project, not affiliated with Microsoft."
```

## 8. Verify

```bash
curl -s https://pypi.org/pypi/outlook-graph-mcp/X.Y.Z/json | python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['info']['version'])"
```

Then install what a new user gets — the published package, into a clean venv, without the lock file — and send `/me` through it:

```bash
uv venv "$TMPDIR/pypi-check" && uv pip install --python "$TMPDIR/pypi-check/bin/python" --refresh outlook-graph-mcp==X.Y.Z
"$TMPDIR/pypi-check/bin/python" tests/test_me_rewrite_reaches_the_wire.py   # expect: OK: /me reaches the wire as /me
```

This is the step that proves the release. `uv.lock` keeps every CI job and developer install on tested versions, so only a lock-free install sees what dependency resolution hands a new user today — the five-week `mcp` outage (2026-07) and #80 (2026-09) both shipped under a fully green suite. `--refresh` matters: uv's index cache once made a just-published version look missing.

And confirm the MCP registry shows the new version as `(latest)`:

```bash
curl -s 'https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io/v0/servers?search=mpalermiti&limit=20' | python3 -c "import json,sys; [print(s['server'].get('version'), '(latest)' if s.get('_meta',{}).get('io.modelcontextprotocol.registry/official',{}).get('isLatest') else '') for s in json.load(sys.stdin).get('servers', [])]"
```


## Appendix — one-time PyPI trusted publisher setup

Step 5 uploads to PyPI without a token by using PyPI's *trusted publishing*: PyPI verifies the workflow through GitHub OIDC rather than a stored API token. It has to be registered once in PyPI's web UI — it cannot be scripted:

1. Go to <https://pypi.org/manage/project/outlook-graph-mcp/settings/publishing/>
2. Add a **GitHub** publisher with exactly:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Owner | `mpalermiti` |
   | Repository | `outlook-mcp` |
   | Workflow name | `publish.yml` |
   | Environment | *(leave blank)* |

Until this is saved, the workflow's PyPI step fails with an OIDC/trusted-publishing error. Once saved, `UV_PUBLISH_TOKEN` is no longer needed and can be dropped from the shell environment.
